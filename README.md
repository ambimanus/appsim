# appsim
This is the glue between the COHDA algorithm from my phd thesis project, and the ApplianceSim framework (a proprietary toolkit from the [OFFIS](http://www.offis.de) institute to simulate electrical appliances such as CHP, HP and Batteries).

Also, there are a bunch of scripts that produce nice plots and statistics (which I used in my thesis as well as in some publications).

Beware, this is not ready for public use, as there is no documentation, and some dependencies are missing. But you may easily find some inspiration here... :)
